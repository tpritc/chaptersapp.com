                <h3>What podcast clients can I view MP3 chapter markers in?</h3>
                <p>MP3 chapter markers are supported by most podcast clients, including <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/">Apple Podcasts on iOS</a> (provided <a href="https://twitter.com/tpritc/status/1004336257651134464">you're on iOS 12</a>), <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href="https://antennapod.org">Antennapod</a> <a href="http://supertop.co/castro/">Castro</a>, <a href="https://www.player.fm">Player FM</a> and more.</p>
                <p>You can get an idea of the podcast clients that support MP3 chapter markers using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2L14UVH1xtN4iDG4awheLbMgPCQgaKEamUauWs1gps/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> (you'll want column W). Please note it's not entirely up-to-date, with MP3 chapter markers quickly gaining adoption across the spectrum of podcast clients.</p>

                <h3>What ID3 version does Podcast Chapters use?</h3>
                <p>Podcast Chapters uses ID3 v2.3 throughout, even if the file that's imported uses a different ID3 tag (or doesn't have one at all).</p>
                <p>This means that if you import a file with ID3 v2.4 metadata that's not supported in ID3 v.2.3, that information will not remain in the exported file. Full support for ID3 2.4 is on my wishlist, please let me know if this is important to you so I can prioritize better!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3>Can I add other podcast metadata in Podcast Chapters?</h3>
                <p>As of Podcast Chapters 2.0, you can set the following non-chapter metadata in your podcasts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Podcast title</li>
                    <li>Podcast authors</li>
                    <li>Podcast artwork</li>
                    <li>Episode title</li>
                    <li>Episode description</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Podcast Chapters also preserves any other ID3 v.2.3 metadata present in the file, so if you like you can use any other tool to add further metadata.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3>Does Podcast Chapters support individual chapter artwork?</h3>
                <p>Yes! As of Podcast Chapters 1.2, you can now add individual chapter artwork. In compatible podcast clients, this will show up as the show art during the time period of the chapter.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3>Can I import markers from [some format]?</h3>
                <p>Podcast Chapters supports import of from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>. You can import either by dragging and dropping the file on Podcast Chapters, or by using the menu option "Import Chapter Markers ..." int the "Chapter" menu. More  <a href="csvImport.html">information on the CSV format can be found here</a>.</p>
                <p>Podcast Chapters also supports importing chapter markers from <code>cue</code> files. You can import markers using the menu, by selecting "Import Chapter Markers ..." from the "Chapter" menu, and selecting a <code>cue</code> file.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>The <code>cue</code> files only support importing the title and the timestamp of a chapter, and if you want to add a URL or an image to the chapter, you will need to do that manually in Podcast Chapters.</p>

                <h3>What happened to Thomas Pritchard?</h3>
                <p>Podcast Chapters was created and developed by Thomas Pritchard from 2016 to March 2019, when he handed charge of the app over to Fredrik Björeman. I (hello!) have lent a hand with the last few releases, and I look forward to keep things going in very much the same style as before. You can read a bit more <a href="https://bjoreman.com/thoughts/adoptingPodcastChapters.html">over here</a>, if you like.</p>

                <p>First of all, that's not a question, it's a statement.</p>
                <p>The best place to ask a question is on Mastodon (<a href="https://toot.cafe/@bjoreman">@bjoreman</a>), my DMs are open.</p>
