                    <li>Fixed a crash when trying to import chapters from a CSV containing time markers only, i.e. no titles or other information. Or, if you prefer to look on the bright side: added support for importing chapter time markers from CSV files containing no other information</li>

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmortizsilva">Jose María Ortiz</a> for reporting the problem!

                    <li>Restoring purchases - which you can find in the app menu, just above preferences - was a process giving very little feedback, especially if you had bought a previous version. Worse, it sometimes looked as if you were still using the free version, even though you had paid and unlimited chapters was actually unlocked! This small fix should resolve that, by both providing some more messages, and making sure the interface updates properly when you have already paid.</li>

If you want more than five chapters, or just want to support the app, unlocking unlimited chapters is a one-time in-app purchase of the same price as the app used to be. Everyone who has already bought the app of course has it unlocked and fully enabled from the start.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This version adds support for export to <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/chapters/jsonChapters.md">JSON chapters format</a>, a new standard for describing podcast chapters in JSON form. A checkbox has been added to the export options, right above the option to generate a web player. The new format is very similar to the old one, but there are differences so anything consuming the exported JSON will need to be changed to use the new format. Therefore, the old format remains the default for now. As the format is so new, the box will need to be checked each time. If everything proceeds as expected with the standard and it gains wider adoption, I expect the new format to eventually replace the old one.</li>

If you combined them with clicking in the main chapter list, the results could be very confusing. The reason was that clicking the list did't update the playback position (as can be seen at the bottom of the window), while the shortcuts looked at the playback position to figure out where to go next. Now, clicking in the list also sets the playback position, simple as that. Big thanks, once more, to <a href="https://twitter.com/tjluoma">TJ Luoma</a> for the problem report!</li>

                    <li>Espisode descriptions are back, enabling you to enter as long or as short a description as you like. (Emoji work too 🎉)</li>
                    <li>The Metadata window has secretly been around for a while, but now it's actually useful enough to mention: It shows you all the MP3 metadata on your file, regardless of which app added it. Identifier, description and - for most types of content - the actual content is displayed. No editing is possible though, at least not yet</li>
                    <li>Oh, and lots of fun improvements under the hood. Well, fun for me, the developer, anyway. Trust me, the seams and back of the cupboard are put together more nicely than ever before</li>

                <h3>Podcast Chapters 1.5 <small>Released May 27, 2019</small></h3>
                <p>1.5 is major on the inside: it's more or less the same nice car with a new engine. Don't worry, it still handles just the same, it just requires less maintenance, uses less fuel and will be easier to upgrade in the future!</p>
                <p>All that said, of course there are a couple of immediately useful additions too:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hidden chapters:</strong> Each chapter now has a checkbox to remove it from the chapter table of contents. This means you can have an image and/or URL show up while the podcast is playing without adding more chapters for the user to choose from. Great for easter eggs! Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobtender">@jacobtender</a> for the suggestion!</li>
                    <li><strong>Chapter with current playback time:</strong> Create a new chapter while the episode is playing, and the chapter will be set to start at the current playback time. This works both with button clicks and the CMD+N keyboard shortcut.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bug fixes:</strong> Fixed lots of problems with opening MP3:s with existing chapters. This means, for example, that if you edit your podcast in an app like <a href="https://hindenburg.com">Hindenburg</a>, you can export your MP3 including chapter information straight from there. The same should go for any other editing app supporting exporting to MP3 with chapters. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/tjluoma">@tjluoma</a> for some great bug reporting!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The next big feature will probably be restoring episode descriptions. It has been requested by multiple users and required this engine change to work well. I also realized while working on thus that descriptions (or comments as they're know inside the ID3 tags) have a bunch of interesting cases to handle if I don't want to mangle existing metadata. And I don't, so I will proceed with some care.</p>
                <p>Thanks again to everyone using the app, everyone who has reported a bug or a wish, and everyone else who makes it fun to develop Podcast Chapters!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bug fix:</strong> Hopefully fixed a crash which could occur if a podcast was opened including a chapter without a title.</li>

                <p>This update simply would not have been possible without the incredible work of <a href="https://twitter.com/bjoreman">Fredrik Björeman</a>, who ported the entire app to Swift 3. This was no small task, and I'm incredibly indebted to him.</p>
                <p>In this update, Podcast Chapters gets a couple of new features, and fixes a few bugs that managed to creep through.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop:</strong> Fredrik has gone through and enabled drag-and-drop all over the app. You can now drag images onto the cover art or chapter image areas, saving you from using the file picker every time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Chapters as Cue Files:</strong> As of Podcast Chapters 1.2 you could import chapter markers from <code>cue</code> files. Well now you can export to them as well! Note: Cue files only allow for a title and a timestamp, so unfortunately any URL or images associated with the chapter aren't exported.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Chapters to Show Notes:</strong> You can now export your chapter markers in a show-note-friendly text format, perfect for listeners who don't have a client that supports MP3 Chapter Markers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bugfixes:</strong> Squashed a number of bugs, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dismissing the import dialog panel would crash the app before (thanks to <a href="http://danieloskarsson.com/">Daniel Oskarsson</a> for sending me their bug report).</li>
                        <li>The eagle-eyed among you might've noticed that 'Chapter Images' was incorrectly titled 'Chapter Information' in the last version. We've fixed that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>The minimum macOS version in this update has changed to macOS Sierra.</p>

                    <li><strong>Chapter Artwork:</strong> You can now add artwork to a chapter marker! Give it a try!</li>

                        <li>Conflicts between the shortcuts for jump time and screenshots. You can now use ⌥⌘1-5 to change the jump amount. This will also now update the menus! (My thanks to Ali Moosa for their help with this)</li>
